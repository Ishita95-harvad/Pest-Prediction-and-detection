# Pest-Prediction-and-detection
Portfolio Projects
This artificial intelligence project aims to create an efficient irrigation and pest detection solution that allows you to make well-informed decisions and improve the yield quality.

Project Idea: The project's first stage comprises installing any programmable device (such as a solenoid valve) at the beginning of the canal pipe/stream. Each of the smaller devices in the field will have a temperature and humidity sensor, which will supply you with real-time sensor data. Create an MQTT network to link each client to the local server device. The second stage of this project entails building a CNN model to predict the growth of a specific pest for a particular crop using the real-time temperature and humidity data. Compute a basic estimate of previous years' NDVI values to compare to the farmers' current land vegetation index and display it on your portal.

Tools and Libraries: CNN, MQTT network

Source Code: Pest Prediction and Detection
